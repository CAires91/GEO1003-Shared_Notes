A nice cheat sheet about Markdown can be found at this link: <https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/>.

On VS Code, there are some nice extensions that can help you write Markdown files:

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) to provide useful shortcuts and commands
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to properly format your Markdown files
