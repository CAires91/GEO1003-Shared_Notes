## Carrier Phase Measurement

Carrier Phase Measurement:

- Measures **fractional phase difference** between the received *carrier wave* from the satellite and a locally generated *replica*.
- Provides a **very precise distance** measure (satellite to receiver)
- Needs to be **initialized** by finding the initial number of carrier wave cycles.
- Is much more precise than pseudorange code measurement. thanks to the **carrier period** being **much smaller** than code chip duration (in L1 CA-code signal, *1540 carrier periods* fit in one PRN spreading code chip).
