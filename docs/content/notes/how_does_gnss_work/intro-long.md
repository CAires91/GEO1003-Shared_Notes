## Introduction

The Global Positioning System (**GPS**), also known as the NAVigation Satellite Time And Ranging (**NAVSTAR**) system had its first satellite launched back in February 1978. GPS is a *one-­way* radio ranging system which provides real­time knowledge of one’s Position and Velocity, and a very accurate Time reference as well (all together referred to as **PVT**).
