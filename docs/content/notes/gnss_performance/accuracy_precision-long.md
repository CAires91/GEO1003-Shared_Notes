## Accuracy and Precision

The receiver can measure the received **signal ­strength**, through the so-­called carrier­-to-­noise-­density ratio $C/N_0$, which gives an indication of the **quality of the measurement** (larger signal­ strength yields more precise measurement).

The **pseudorange measurement** precision is typically at the *one or few meter* level for low­-cost, mass-­market equipment, and can get down to the *few decimeter level* for professional high­end equipment.

The **carrier phase measurement** precision ranges from the *few centimeter to the millimeter level*. The carrier phase is an ambiguous measurement of distance, but it is more precise than the pseudorange, typically by **two orders of magnitude**.
