## 3 - Potential PPP-RTK Based Applications

### Introduction

Achieving precise GNSS positioning with low-cost sensors is challenging. High-end GNSS systems like NRTK and PPP require expensive receivers and real-time correction signals, limiting mass market adoption. However, PPP-RTK can enable more accurate positioning for applications such as autonomous vehicles, requiring 20-30 cm accuracy.

### Current Usage

- **Agriculture**: Used for automated farming tasks, with significant growth expected.
- **Surveying**: High accuracy needed; PPP-RTK bridges PPP and RTK by reducing reliance on infrastructure.
- **Mining**: Enhances performance in large fleets with remote control of machines.
- **Marine**: Widely used for navigation, and PPP-RTK promises improved accuracy.
- **Geospatial Information Systems (GIS)**: Enhances data collection with improved accuracy.
- **Aviation**: Used for air traffic management, with expansion planned.
- **Rail**: High accuracy aids automated train control.

### Future Usage

- **3D Digital Maps**: Could support disaster planning, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles.
- **Smartphones**: GNSS improvements needed for accurate PPP-RTK; expected to enhance AR applications.
- **Navigation Maps**: Can improve user location accuracy in mass-market apps.
- **Automotive**: PPP-RTK will complement other sensors like LIDAR for autonomous vehicles, though it can't solely rely on GNSS due to issues like latency and reliability.
- **Augmented Reality**: Enhanced positioning could improve user experience in AR games.
- **Autonomous Robotics**: Robots can use GNSS as a secondary data source for navigation.
- **Sports Tracking**: Professional athletes would benefit from enhanced GNSS accuracy for performance analysis.

### Market Trends

PPP-RTK technology is currently more suitable for professional applications, with limited real-world demonstrations for mass market adoption. It will complement existing technologies like PPP and RTK, particularly in autonomous systems where it serves as secondary data to other sensors.
