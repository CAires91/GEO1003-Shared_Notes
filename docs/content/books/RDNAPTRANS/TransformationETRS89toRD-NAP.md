## Transformation from ETRS89 to RD and NAP
### Notation in degrees, minutes and seconds
ETRS89 coordinates are commonly expressed in ellipsoidal geographic coordinates latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height.

Height in meters
N or positive decimal degrees (d.d)
S or negative decimal degrees (d.d)  
E or positive decimal degrees (d.d)
W or negative decimal degrees (d.d)

The number of needed decimals in degrees, minutes and seconds for a resolution corresponding to approximately 0.01 m, are given in the examples below:

Examples of notation of 2D ellipsoidal geographic coordinates 
D M S.S: 52° 5′ 29.870″ N, 5° 7′ 18.141″ E (Dutch notation: 52° 5′ 29,870″ NB; 5° 7′ 18,141″ OL) 
D M.M: 52° 5.49783′ N, 5° 7.30235′ E (Dutch notation: 52° 5,49783′ NB; 5° 7,30235′ OL) 
D.D: 52.0916305° N, 5.1217059° E (Dutch notation: 52,0916305° NB; 5,1217059° OL) 
d.d: +52.0916305°, +5.1217059° (Dutch notation: +52,0916305°; +5,1217059°)

To transform the coordinates of a point of interest, its ETRS89 coordinates must be converted first to decimal degrees or to radians (Formula 2.1), depending on the type of goniometry functions used.
